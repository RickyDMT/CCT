Every time you turn over a gain card you get the points added to your round total and you have the chance to turn over another card. The first time you turn over a loss card, the loss points are subtracted from your current point total and the round immediately ends. \n\n\nYou can decide to stop turning over cards at any point, as long as you have not yet turned over a loss card. Then the accumulated total will be your number of points for this round, and you go on to the next round. Each new round starts with a score of 0 points; that means you play each round independently of the other rounds. \n\n\n Press space to continue.
