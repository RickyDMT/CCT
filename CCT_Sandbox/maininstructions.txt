You are now going to participate in a card game. In this game, you will turn over cards to win or lose points which are worth money. \n\nIn each game round, there will be 32 cards on the computer screen, face down. You will decide how many of these cards to turn over. \n\nEach card is either a gain card or a loss card (there are no neutral cards). \n\nYou will know how many gain cards and loss cards are in the deck of 32, and how many points you will gain or lose if you turn over a gain or loss card. What you don't know is which of the 32 cards that you see face-down are gain cards and which are loss cards. \n\n Press space to continue.
